# Project: Building A Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

## Objective

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

## Specifications

- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

## Outcomes

- Experience gained using Notion and draw.io for documenting and tracking project work
- Experience gained planning out a data warehouse project, designing data warehousing architecture and implementing the project tasks
- Competency gained in creating efficient ETL processes using SQL/SSMS to transform and prepare data for consumption by end users
- Competency gained in conducting effective data quality checking throughout the ETL development process to ensure data integrity is maintained
- Competency gained in utilizing GitHub as a repository for data project documentation, scripts and testing
